# HyNet
HyNet: 3D Segmentation Using Hybrid Graph Networks

HyNet is a novel representation learning framework that encodes mesh elements by focusing on the most relevant parts of geometric structure. We have adopted HyNet for 3D mesh segmentation.


## Installation
-Clone this repository.
-Install dependencies using environment.yml .

## 3D Shape Segmentation
Run the related bash script from ./scripts for the following tasks. Example: 
- Download the dataset
- Convert mesh files to hybrid graph
- To train a HyNet model,
- Run test and save predicted segmentation
- Run test on test dataset and get accuracy
- Visualize segmentation result
- Get pretrained model run the related bash script in ./scripts .
