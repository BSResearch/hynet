def preprocess_mesh(input_mesh, prevent_nonmanifold_edges=True):
    r"""Removes duplicated vertices, duplicated faces, zero-area faces, and
    optionally faces the insertion of which would cause an edge of the mesh to
    become non-manifold. In particular, an iteration is performed over all faces
    in the mesh, keeping track of the half-edges in each face, and if a face
    contains a half-edge already found in one of the faces previously processed,
    it gets removed from the mesh.

    Args:
        input_mesh (pymesh.Mesh.Mesh): Mesh to preprocess.
        prevent_nonmanifold_edges (bool, optional): If True, faces that would
            cause an edge to become non-manifold are removed from the mesh (cf.
            above). (default: :obj:`True`)

    Returns:
        output_mesh (pymesh.Mesh.Mesh): Mesh after preprocessing.
